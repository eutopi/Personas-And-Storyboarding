    <h1>On Personas & Storyboards: A Study of the Washing Machine UI</h1>
    <!-- TODO: put your HTML code here! -->
    <p>The washing machine is an essential household item found in most homes. Despite
      playing such an integral role in our everyday lives, it is not always easy to operate:
      while some washing machine interfaces only comprise of a few buttons, others are much
      more complicated. By observing how real users interact with these more convoluted 
      interfaces, we can gain valuable designs insights by creating personas and storyboards
      to create future products better suited to their needs in the future. 
    </p>

    <h2>The Washing Machine UI</h2>

    The following is a sketch of a more complicated washing machine interface.
    <figure>
      <img class="interface-sketch" src="./img/interface-sketch.png" />
      <figcaption>This interface lets the user select different settings at which 
        to wash their clothes. The interactive components function as follows: 
        (1) press the power button to turn on, (2) rotate the knob to determine the mode,
        (3) press the flat buttons to finetune settings, and (4) press the start button to confirm. </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <h2>User Observations</h2>

    <p>To explore how everyday users interacted with this interface, I observed and interviewed 3
      users who had access to the interface. To guarantee a wide spectrum of possible experiences,
      one user was chosen because they had never seen the interface before while the two other were
      selected as they were previously seen using the interface.
    </p>

    <h3>User 1</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Started with the right panel on the interface: tried pressing on 
        the flat buttons but didn't get a response, expressed a "what?"</li>
      <li>After finding the power button, clicked and rotated through all the flat 
        button and knob options, respectively
      <li>Expressed an "oh my god" when clicking the "Delay Wash" button as the
        blue display cycled through numbers 1-13 before returning to 0, 
        at which the user moved on to other buttons</li>
      <li>Asked "where is the timer?" twice</li>
      <li>Changed the knob back to "Normal" mode before pressing start button</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>User 2</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Started by pressing the power button, then immediately rotated the knob
        to "Normal" mode and pressed the start button
      </li>
      <li>Glanced at, but did not touch the right panel at all
      <li>After pressing the start button, noted the timer on the display 
        and created a corresponding one on their phone
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>User 3</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Started by pressing the power button, then rotated the knob to "Heavy Duty" mode</li>
      <li>Pressed the "TEMP" and "Extra Rinse" flat buttons on the right panel, both repeatedly without
        waiting for a response, then more times again to correct themselves.
      </li>
      <li>Tapped foot periodically through the session</li>
      <li>Spent around the same time pressing buttons as User 2, even though they had more 
        buttons to press.
      </li>
    </ul>

    From these observations, it seems like although the interface is rather unfriendly to new users, experienced 
    users can manipulate it easily with repeated usage. This choice in design seems well suited
    for the washing machine, since it is a machine typical someone uses on a at least monthly if not weekly basis.

    <h2>Interview Questions</h2>

      After interacting with the washing machine interface, each user was then asked the following
      questions. Their responses are summarized below:
      <ol>
        <li>How often do you use washing machines?
          <div class="question-responses">
            The second user uses washing machines weekly while the others use them biweekly.
          </div>
        <li>In general, you find washing machine interfaces ______ to use.
          <div class="slidecontainer">
            <span class="left">Extremely easy (1)</span>​<span class="right">Extremely difficult (10)</span>
            <input type="range" min="1" max="10" value="1" class="slider" id="myRange">
          </div>
          <div class="question-responses">
            All users seem to agree that washing machine interfaces in general were relatively easy (3-4) to use.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>On average, how long do you think it should take to set and start a washing machine?</li>
        <div class="question-responses">
          The first-time user expected a longer time (2 minutes) while the experienced users expected less time (30 seconds, 1 minute).
          Interesting, the user who expected the longest time also spent the longest time on the interface. This could be
          a example of expectations translating into actions.
        </div>
        <li>What was your goal when using the interface?</li>
        <div class="question-responses">
          Each user had different goals: the first-time user wanted to understand what all the buttons 
          meant since it was their first time using it, one experienced user (User 2) only wanted to begin washing their clothes as soon as possible, and
          the other experienced user (User 3) wanted to pick a setting for heavy soiled laundry quickly.
        </div>
        <li>Describe the process of starting the washing machine using this interface. Why?
          <div class="slidecontainer">
            <span class="left">Extremely easy (1)</span>​<span class="right">Extremely difficult (10)</span>
            <input type="range" min="1" max="10" value="1" class="slider" id="myRange">
          </div></li>
          <div class="question-responses">
            The first two users found starting the machine quite easy (4, 2), stating that there are two
            very obvious power and start buttons that they needed to press. However, User 2 did note that they only knew how to set the basic "Normal" mode setting and had no idea how to set the
            other ones since they had no interest in altering the settings. User 3 chose average difficulty (5), stating that there were a lot of buttons and 
            it was not immediately clear what the display is showing since the response to button presses were not quick enough.
          </div>
        <li>You understood what the washing machine was capable of from the interface. Why/why not?
          <div class="slidecontainer">
            <span class="left">Strongly agree (1)</span>​<span class="right">Strongly disagree (10)</span>
            <input type="range" min="1" max="10" value="1" class="slider" id="myRange">
          </div>
        </li>
        <div class="question-responses">
          User 2 who focused on speed disagreed (7), stating that too many 
          modes made it confusing and deterred them from exploring the functions. The other two users agreed (3, 4),
          noting that the usage of text labels instead of symbols directly conveyed their functionality and despite
          being slightly overwhelming at first, the responsive indicators of the interface helped them understand
          what the buttons did (although User 3 didn't like how the response was slightly delayed).
        </div>
        <li>Describe your overall experience using the interface. Why?
          <div class="slidecontainer">
            <span class="left">Very enjoyable (1)</span>​<span class="right">Very frustrating (10)</span>
            <input type="range" min="1" max="10" value="1" class="slider" id="myRange">
          </div>
        </li>
        <div class="question-responses">
          Only the second user enjoyed using the interface (3), stating that they liked the sounds of the buttons.
          The other two users were more neutral (5, 6), noting that it just "got the job done."
        </div>
      </ol>

    
      <h2>Personas</h2>

      Based on overarching trends from the observations and interview answers above, 
      I constructed two personas using a four-quadrant empathy map in hopes of creating good representations
      of the spectrum of users that may interact with the washing machine interface.

      <div class="persona-container">
        <figure class="personas">
          <img src="./img/curiouscharlie.svg" />
          <figcaption><b>Curious Charlie</b> is a retired academic who still loves to learn. Meticulous and punctual, 
            he recently stained his favorite shirt. <br></br> His main issue with the washing machine interface is that it is
            very different from the ones he is used to and he cannot find functions that are important to him (i.e the
            timer) that the washing machine surely has from the display. <br></br>This persona takes his carefulness, 
            curiosity, and eventually understanding of the interface from User 1, his focus on the timer from Users 1 and 2, 
            and his focus on hot water / heavier settings from User 3. </figcaption>
        </figure>
  
        <figure class="personas">
          <img src="./img/impatienticarus.svg" />
          <figcaption><b>Impatient Icarus</b> is a middle schooler who loves video games. Because he played
          too much recently, his mom tasked him with doing the laundry. <br></br> (As a first time user) He finds the clutter of 
          the washing machine interface overwhelming (especially the right panel) and thinks it takes too long to learn as he
          does not interact with the other buttons. <br></br> This persona takes his short outbursts from User 1,
          his short button press patterns and subsequent lack of understanding from User 2, and his impatience from User 3</figcaption>
        </figure>
      </div>

      <h2>Storyboard</h2>

      Using the Impatient Icarus persona from above, I then created a storyboard envisioning how this persona 
      will typically react and use the washing machine interface:

      <img class="storyboard" src="./img/storyboard.png" />

      <p>Overall, it seems like despite a complicated interface that puts off first-time users from accessing all
        the functions of the washing machine, the interface still does its job in allowing the user to <i>start</i> it. Possible 
        improvements to its understandability can include faster response times for the light indicators as well as
        a cleaner layout design that appears less cluttered.
